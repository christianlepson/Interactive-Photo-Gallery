# Interactive jQuery Photo Gallery

This responsive, interactive photo gallery was developed using jQuery, HTML, and CSS. The app features a search bar that will automatically update the gallery with images that have descriptions matching the user's input. Clicking a photo will open the gallery's photos in a lightbox.
